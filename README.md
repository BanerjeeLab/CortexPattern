### System Requirements ###

This code is run in python3 using the FiPy package https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/

### QUICKSTART GUIDE ###

The files contain our code to run the following simulations:
- system0D.py: our 0D model for RhoA-actomyosin-strain
- system1D.py: our 1D model including advection
- system1D_activation.py: our 1D model with a temporary increase in RhoA production near the center of the system
- system2D.py: our 2D model

Each file contains a minimal example showing how to run the relevant simulation.
